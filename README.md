## 1. About this Project 

This is a project that I create in the Algorithms and Data Structure class. The motivation of this project is to create a scheduler using a heap structure.
In this project, I insert a list of tasks I need to complete a day, with duration, dependencies of tasks, and happiness scores. 
The scheduler is able to 
- consider a task when its task is fixed: class time 
- allow multi-tasking: go to class while texting friends
- put tasks in order given the dependencies: brush my teeth before going to bed 
- make priorities based on happiness score: do the task I don't like the most 

Time: Spring 2021
Duration: 2 weeks
Language: Python
Techniques: Heap structure
